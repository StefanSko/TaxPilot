## Problem Statement

The current search implementation returns individual text segments rather than complete legal articles, creating several user experience issues:

- Users see disconnected segments without proper context
- It's difficult to understand where segments fit within legal structure
- Relevance scores are calculated at segment level, not article level
- No clear boundaries between different legal articles in results

## Solution Overview

Enhance the search system to return complete articles/sections while preserving semantic search capabilities by implementing:

1. **Hierarchical Document Structure**
2. **Two-Phase Search**
3. **Result Aggregation**
4. **Improved Result Presentation**

## Implementation Checklist

### 1. Enhanced Segmentation Process ✅

- [x] Modify `TextSegment` class to include hierarchical information:
  - [x] Add `article_id` field alongside existing `section_id`
  - [x] Add `hierarchy_path` field to store full path (e.g., "estg/§13/abs2/satz1")
  - [x] Add `segment_type` field (article, paragraph, sentence)
  - [x] Track position within parent (e.g., paragraph number within article)

- [x] Update segmentation functions to preserve legal structure:
  - [x] Identify article boundaries during segmentation
  - [x] Recognize paragraph and subsection structures
  - [x] Maintain original numbering from legal text

### 2. Vector Database Enhancements ✅

- [x] Modify vector database payload structure:
  - [x] Add hierarchical identifiers to each vector entry
  - [x] Store article-level metadata alongside segment data
  - [x] Add structural position information

- [x] Create article-to-segment mapping:
  - [x] Build index of segments belonging to each article
  - [x] Store relationship between segments and articles

### 3. Two-Phase Search Implementation ✅

- [x] Modify `SearchService.search()` method:
  - [x] Phase 1: Execute semantic search on segments (existing approach)
  - [x] Phase 2: Group results by article/section
  - [x] Aggregate scores for segments within same article

- [x] Add score aggregation strategies:
  - [x] Implement max score (best matching segment determines article relevance)
  - [x] Implement weighted average (all segment matches contribute to article score)
  - [x] Implement count-based boosting (articles with more matching segments rank higher)

### 4. Result Processing Updates ✅

- [x] Modify `_enrich_results()` method:
  - [x] Group segments by article/section ID
  - [x] Fetch complete article content instead of just segments
  - [x] Combine metadata from all matching segments

- [x] Create new `ArticleResult` class:
  - [x] Include complete article text and structure
  - [x] Store relevance score for entire article
  - [x] Track which segments matched and their individual scores
  - [x] Support for highlighting multiple segments within article

### 5. Database Query Optimization ✅

- [x] Optimize database queries for article retrieval:
  - [x] Create efficient query to get complete article content
  - [x] Fetch article structure and metadata in single query
  - [x] Implement caching for frequently accessed articles

- [x] Add indexing for faster article lookup:
  - [x] Create indexes on hierarchy fields
  - [x] Optimize for article-level retrieval

### 6. Result Presentation Improvements ✅

- [x] Enhance `QueryResult` to support article-based results:
  - [x] Include article number and title prominently
  - [x] Show law abbreviation (e.g., "EStG § 13")
  - [x] Present complete article with proper formatting
  - [x] Highlight all matching segments within article
  - [x] Indicate why article matched (which concepts matched)

- [x] Implement smart snippet selection:
  - [x] Show most relevant parts of article based on match strength
  - [x] Provide context around matching segments
  - [x] Include proper heading hierarchy

### 7. Examples and Documentation ✅

- [x] Create example scripts demonstrating functionality:
  - [x] Add side-by-side comparison of segment vs. article results
  - [x] Provide runnable demos for different search approaches
  - [x] Document article-based search functionality

- [x] Update technical documentation:
  - [x] Add article-based search to design decisions
  - [x] Document API parameters for article-based search
  - [x] Explain scoring and grouping mechanisms

### 8. Codebase Reorganization ✅

- [x] Relocate example scripts to dedicated directory:
  - [x] Create examples/ directory with proper organization
  - [x] Add README for examples with usage information
  - [x] Create simplified demos that don't require external dependencies

- [x] Reorganize test files:
  - [x] Move article search tests to proper test directory
  - [x] Enhance test coverage for article-based search
  - [x] Fix integration tests for search functionality

## Testing and Validation

- [x] Create test suite for basic hierarchical segmentation:
  - [x] Test article detection and structure extraction
  - [x] Test hierarchical path construction
  - [x] Test segmentation with hierarchy at different levels

- [x] Create test suite for article-based search:
  - [x] Test accurate grouping of segments to articles
  - [x] Test relevance scoring at article level
  - [x] Test highlighting of multiple matches within article
  - [x] Compare precision/recall with segment-based approach

- [x] Implementation validation:
  - [x] Ensure functionality works with various search parameters
  - [x] Test with different aggregation strategies
  - [x] Validate in-memory operation for demos
  - [x] Confirm proper handling of database connections

## Implementation Status
