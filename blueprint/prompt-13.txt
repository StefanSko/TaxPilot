Develop comprehensive result display components for the GermanLawFinder frontend. Create:

1. A ResultCard component that:
   - Displays law section information clearly
   - Shows section title, number, and law source
   - Highlights matched terms in the content
   - Provides context around the matches
   - Includes expansion/collapse functionality

2. Implement a DetailView component:
   - Shows the full content of a selected result
   - Displays hierarchical context (parent sections)
   - Provides navigation to related sections
   - Includes proper formatting of legal text structure

3. Create a ResultsList component:
   - Renders a list of ResultCard components
   - Handles different result types and formats
   - Implements virtual scrolling for performance
   - Provides sorting options (relevance, section number)

4. Develop ContentFormatter utility:
   - Properly formats legal text with indentation
   - Handles special characters and formatting
   - Preserves paragraph structure
   - Renders tables and lists correctly

5. Add interactive features:
   - Bookmark/save functionality
   - Copy citation button
   - Print/export options
   - Sharing capabilities

Ensure components follow accessibility best practices and render correctly across different devices and screen sizes. Use TypeScript throughout with proper type definitions. The components should provide a professional, clean presentation of legal content optimized for readability and usability by tax attorneys.
