Implement comprehensive testing and quality assurance for GermanLawFinder. Create:

1. Backend testing:
   - Unit tests for core modules (parser, search, authentication)
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - Mocking strategies for external dependencies
   - Performance benchmarks for critical operations

2. Frontend testing:
   - Component tests using Vitest
   - Store and composable function tests
   - Mock service worker for API simulation
   - Snapshot testing for UI components

3. End-to-end testing:
   - Cypress test suite for critical user flows
   - Visual regression testing
   - Cross-browser compatibility tests
   - Mobile responsiveness testing

4. Quality assurance automation:
   - GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD
   - Linting and code quality checks
   - Type checking with mypy and TypeScript
   - Code coverage reporting

5. Legal accuracy testing:
   - Test suite for citation formatting
   - Validation of search results against known legal documents
   - Content comparison with official sources
   - Expert review process

The implementation should ensure comprehensive test coverage for all critical system components and user flows. Include documentation for test approaches and coverage goals. Set up automation to run tests in CI/CD pipelines and provide clear reporting of test results.
