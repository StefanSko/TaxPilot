Implement the integration between the Vue.js frontend and FastAPI backend for GermanLawFinder. Create:

1. An API service layer that:
   - Provides typed functions for all backend API calls
   - Handles authentication headers and tokens
   - Implements request/response interceptors
   - Manages error handling and retry logic

2. Create Pinia stores for:
   - Search state and actions
   - User authentication
   - Application configuration
   - Search history and bookmarks

3. Implement data transformation utilities:
   - Convert API responses to frontend models
   - Format dates and specialized legal text
   - Normalize search results for display
   - Handle different response formats

4. Add request optimization:
   - Implement request cancellation for superseded searches
   - Add debouncing for search input
   - Cache common responses
   - Handle offline mode and reconnection

5. Create error handling components:
   - Error message display
   - Retry functionality
   - Fallback content for failed requests
   - User-friendly error messages

The implementation should follow best practices for frontend-backend communication and handle real-world scenarios like slow networks, intermittent failures, and concurrent requests. Use TypeScript throughout with proper typing of API responses and requests. Include comprehensive error handling and logging.
