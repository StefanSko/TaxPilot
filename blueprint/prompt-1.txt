Create the initial structure for the GermanLawFinder project. Set up a Python 3.12 project with the following:

1. Create a directory structure that separates:
   - Backend (API, data processing, search functionality)
   - Frontend (Vue.js application)
   - Infrastructure (Modal.com configuration)
   - Data (storage for scraped content and processed data)
   - Tests

2. Initialize a Python project with:
   - pyproject.toml for Poetry dependency management
   - Required dependencies: fastapi, uvicorn, lxml, python-dotenv, modal, duckdb, pydantic
   - Dev dependencies: pytest, black, flake8, mypy

3. Create a basic README.md with:
   - Project description
   - Setup instructions
   - Development guidelines

The project should follow modern Python practices with strong typing (Python 3.12) and a clean, maintainable structure. Include a .gitignore file suitable for Python and Vue.js development.

Output the complete directory structure and the content of key configuration files.
