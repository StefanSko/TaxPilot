## Data Processing Pipeline

### Data Acquisition and Source Format Handling
1. Web scraping module using Scrapy or BeautifulSoup to extract content from official government websites
2. Scraping frequency: Once per month with change detection
3. XML parsing system to handle the specific German law XML format:
   - Process XML structure as shown in the provided sample (from gesetze-im-internet.de)
   - Extract and properly structure elements from the DTD-based format (gii-norm.dtd)
   - Handle specific elements like `<norm>`, `<metadaten>`, `<textdaten>`, `<table>`, etc.
4. Parse document structure preserving hierarchical relationships:
   - Sections (§)
   - Subsections
   - Paragraphs
   - References and cross-references

### Content Processing
1. XML structure parsing
   - Use Python's `lxml` or `ElementTree` libraries optimized for the German law XML format
   - Extract metadata (`<metadaten>`) including law identifiers, dates, and status
   - Process content data (`<textdaten>`) with preservation of formatting and structure
   - Handle special XML elements like tables and formatting tags
2. Text cleaning and normalization
   - Remove XML artifacts and format consistently
   - Normalize German special characters and legal abbreviations
3. Structural parsing (identifying sections, paragraphs, articles)
   - Map the hierarchical structure from XML to database schema
   - Preserve relationships between elements
4. Reference extraction (cross-references between laws)
   - Identify and index internal references within and between laws
5. Version control to track changes over time

### Vector Embedding Generation
1. Legal text segmentation into appropriate chunks
2. Generation of embeddings using German-language legal text models

## XML Source Format Considerations

The provided sample demonstrates that the source data follows a specific XML format from gesetze-im-internet.de with these key characteristics:

1. **DTD-Based Structure**: The XML follows the gii-norm.dtd document type definition
2. **Hierarchical Organization**:
   - `<dokumente>` as the root element with builddate and doknr (document number) attributes
   - `<norm>` elements containing individual law sections
   - `<metadaten>` containing law metadata (dates, identifiers, titles):
     - `<jurabk>` and `<amtabk>` - Legal abbreviations (e.g., "EStG")
     - `<ausfertigung-datum>` - Date of issue
     - `<fundstelle>` - Source reference with publication and citation
     - `<langue>` - Full title (e.g., "Einkommensteuergesetz")
     - `<standangabe>` - Status information with type and comments
   - `<textdaten>` containing the actual legal text content
3. **Complex Tabular Data**: Tables are used extensively to represent law structures:
   - Table structures with `<tgroup>`, `<tbody>`, `<row>`, and `<entry>` elements
   - Entries with section numbers (§) and corresponding titles
4. **Special Formatting Elements**: 
   - `<Title>` elements with different classes for hierarchy levels
   - `<TOC>` elements for table of contents
   - `<Ident>` for section identifiers
5. **Cross-Reference System**: Internal reference system between law sections

The system will need specialized XML processing components based on Python's lxml library to handle this format efficiently and preserve all structural information during the conversion to searchable content.

## DuckDB Implementation Details

### Database Schema

1. **Laws Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE laws (
    id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,               -- e.g., "estg"
    full_name VARCHAR,                    -- e.g., "Einkommensteuergesetz"
    abbreviation VARCHAR,                 -- e.g., "EStG"
    last_updated DATE,                    -- Last modification date
    issue_date DATE,                      -- Original issue date
    status_info VARCHAR,                  -- Current status information
    metadata JSON                         -- Additional metadata as JSON
);
```

2. **Sections Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE sections (
    id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,               -- e.g., "estg_2" for § 2
    law_id VARCHAR,                       -- Foreign key to laws table
    section_number VARCHAR,               -- e.g., "2"
    title VARCHAR,                        -- Section title
    content TEXT,                         -- Full text content
    parent_section_id VARCHAR,            -- For hierarchical structure
    hierarchy_level INTEGER,              -- Depth in document structure
    path VARCHAR,                         -- Full hierarchical path
    metadata JSON,                        -- Additional metadata
    FOREIGN KEY (law_id) REFERENCES laws(id)
);
```

3. **Section Embeddings Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE section_embeddings (
    section_id VARCHAR REFERENCES sections(id),
    embedding FLOAT[384],                 -- Vector embedding (dimension depends on model)
    PRIMARY KEY (section_id)
);
```

### Example Queries

1. **Boolean Search**
```sql
-- Search for sections containing both "Homeoffice" and "Steuer" but not "Ausland"
SELECT s.id, s.section_number, s.title, s.content
FROM sections s
WHERE s.law_id = 'estg' 
  AND s.content LIKE '%Homeoffice%' 
  AND s.content LIKE '%Steuer%' 
  AND s.content NOT LIKE '%Ausland%'
ORDER BY s.section_number;
```

2. **Combined Vector and Boolean Search**
```sql
-- Assuming vector_results is a temporary table with section_ids from vector search
WITH vector_results AS (
  SELECT section_id, similarity_score
  FROM vector_search_results
  WHERE search_query_id = 'current_search'
)
SELECT s.id, s.section_number, s.title, 
       vr.similarity_score, 
       s.content
FROM sections s
JOIN vector_results vr ON s.id = vr.section_id
WHERE s.law_id = 'estg'
  AND (s.content LIKE '%Homeoffice%' OR s.content LIKE '%home office%')
ORDER BY vr.similarity_score DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
